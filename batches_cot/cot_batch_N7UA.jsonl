{"qid": "52a5095ce9ac6b3c7ae0", "transform_type": "llama", "original_question": "Can a software engineer work during a power outage?", "model_answer": "yes", "followup_question": "Can a software engineer work without a computer?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: A software engineer typically relies on electronic devices such as computers to perform their work. During a power outage, these devices may not function unless there is an alternative power source such as a generator or a fully charged laptop battery. Additionally, if the power outage affects internet connectivity, it could further hinder a software engineer's ability to work, especially if their tasks require online access. However, it is still possible for a software engineer to perform some offline tasks or planning during a power outage if they have a power-independent setup.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"qid": "f353cbd3286ea1e452aa", "transform_type": "llama", "original_question": "Can telescopes hear noise?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Can microphones hear noise?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Telescopes are designed to observe distant objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation, such as light. They do not have components that can detect or interpret sound waves, which are mechanical waves requiring a medium like air or water to travel through. Since telescopes are not equipped to detect sound, they cannot hear noise.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"qid": "c69a3eeea9743e782831", "transform_type": "lexical_substitution", "original_question": "Do members of the Supreme Court of the United States have longer terms than most senators?", "model_answer": "yes", "followup_question": "Do members of the administrative district have longer terms than most senators?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Members of the Supreme Court of the United States are appointed for life, meaning they serve until they choose to retire, pass away, or are impeached. In contrast, U.S. Senators are elected for six-year terms and may be re-elected for multiple terms. Comparing a lifetime appointment to a six-year term, the Supreme Court justices clearly have longer terms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"qid": "076f905ae36408b5ee69", "transform_type": "pre_flip", "original_question": "Is lunch on the beach a good activity to spot the full circle of a rainbow?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "If one were having lunch on a high platform on the beach, would it be a good activity to spot the full circle of a rainbow?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Spotting the full circle of a rainbow typically requires specific conditions, such as having the sun behind you and a sufficient amount of moisture in the air in front of you. Being on a beach for lunch generally means the sun is above or in front of you, not behind. Additionally, the horizon over the ocean may limit visibility of a full circle rainbow, which is easier to see from a higher altitude with a panoramic view. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"qid": "042101b10af2b128df10", "transform_type": "contextualization", "original_question": "Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "The DRL Racer X drone can cover around 3 miles a minute. Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?", "explanation": "The Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 1.1 miles (1.77 kilometers) long. To determine if the DRL Racer X drone can cross it in 18 seconds, we need to calculate the required speed. The speed required would be 1.77 kilometers divided by 18 seconds, which equals approximately 0.0983 kilometers per second, or about 353.88 kilometers per hour (219.9 miles per hour). The DRL Racer X drone has a top speed of around 179 kilometers per hour (111 miles per hour). Since 179 kilometers per hour is less than the required 353.88 kilometers per hour, the drone cannot cross the Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds. So the answer is no."}

Each row, column, and subgrid must contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. Roman numerals are a numeral system originating in ancient Rome, using combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to signify values. The numbers 1 through 9 in Roman numerals are I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX. Since each of these is distinct and there are exactly nine of them, they can be used to fill the grid following the same rules as Arabic numerals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"qid": "157913fa4c74220aff2d", "transform_type": "lexical_substitution", "original_question": "Could pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago be good still?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Could melons from 1,000 years ago be good still?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Pickled cucumbers, like any other food, have a shelf life. Even though pickling is a method of preservation, it does not keep food good indefinitely. The preservation through pickling involves acid, salt, and sometimes sugar, which can extend the shelf life of foods significantly. However, over a long period, such as 1,000 years, it is highly unlikely that pickled cucumbers would remain safe to eat. The physical and chemical properties of the cucumbers would degrade over time, potentially leading to spoilage and the development of harmful bacteria or toxins.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
