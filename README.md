# User Study Interface (Flask)

This repository contains a small Flask web interface for the user study: **Evaluating Counterfactual Simulatability with Pragmatic Perturbations**

Each participant runs the interface **locally** on their own machine and the results are saved to a local file, which they then send back to the researcher.

> If you are a participant: please follow the instructions below step by step.
