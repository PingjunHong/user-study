{"qid": "157913fa4c74220aff2d", "transform_type": "scalar_adjustment", "original_question": "Could pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago be good still?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Could pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago be perfect still?", "explanation": "No. Pickled cucumbers from 1,000 years ago would not be good still because the preservation methods available at that time, although effective for shorter periods, would not be able to maintain the cucumbers' edibility over such an extended period. The risk of bacterial growth and degradation of the cucumbers' texture and taste over a millennium would make them unsafe and unpalatable. So the answer is no."}

{"qid": "042101b10af2b128df10", "transform_type": "scalar_adjustment", "original_question": "Can DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Should DRL Racer X drone get across Brooklyn Bridge in 18 seconds?", "explanation": "No.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is approximately 1.1 miles long. The DRL Racer X drone has a top speed of about 179.6 mph. To calculate the time it would take for the drone to cross the bridge, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Converting the bridge length to miles, we get 1.1 miles. Using the drone's speed, the calculation would be 1.1 miles / 179.6 mph ≈ 0.0061 hours. Converting hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds), we get 0.0061 hours * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 22 seconds. Therefore, it would take the drone approximately 22 seconds to cross the Brooklyn Bridge, not 18 seconds. So the answer is no."}
