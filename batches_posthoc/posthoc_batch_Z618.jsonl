The DRL Racer X drone has a top speed of about 179.6 mph. To calculate the time it would take for the drone to cross the bridge, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Converting the bridge length to miles, we get 1.1 miles. Using the drone's speed, the calculation would be 1.1 miles / 179.6 mph ≈ 0.0061 hours. Converting hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds), we get 0.0061 hours * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 22 seconds. Therefore, it would take the drone approximately 22 seconds to cross the Brooklyn Bridge, not 18 seconds. So the answer is no."}

The USDA recommends a daily fat intake of about 78 grams for a 2000 calorie diet. A single McDonald's hamburger contains about 9 grams of fat. Therefore, seven hamburgers would total 63 grams of fat, which is well within the daily limit. However, considering that other meals and snacks throughout the day also contribute to fat intake, consuming seven hamburgers in one day would likely exceed the recommended allowance when combined with other sources of fat. So the answer is yes."}

Roman numerals, however, are represented by letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and combinations thereof, which do not correspond directly to the single-digit numbers used in Sudoku. Additionally, the structure of Roman numerals, where values are added or subtracted based on order, does not lend itself to the simple, single-digit placement required in Sudoku. So the answer is no."}
