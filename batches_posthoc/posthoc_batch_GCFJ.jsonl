The DRL Racer X drone has a top speed of about 179.6 mph. To calculate the time it would take for the drone to cross the bridge, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Converting the bridge length to miles, we get 1.1 miles. Using the drone's speed, the calculation would be 1.1 miles / 179.6 mph ≈ 0.0061 hours. Converting hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds), we get 0.0061 hours * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 22 seconds. Therefore, it would take the drone approximately 22 seconds to cross the Brooklyn Bridge, not 18 seconds. So the answer is no."}
