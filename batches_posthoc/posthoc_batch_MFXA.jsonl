{"qid": "096acbba9f3e51c0f722", "transform_type": "pre_flip", "original_question": "Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?", "model_answer": "yes", "followup_question": "If each McDonald's hamburger contained twice the current fat content, would seven hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended fat allowance?", "explanation": "Yes, seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended fat allowance. The USDA recommends a daily fat intake of about 78 grams for a 2000 calorie diet. A single McDonald's hamburger contains about 9 grams of fat. Therefore, seven hamburgers would total 63 grams of fat, which is well within the daily limit. However, considering that other meals and snacks throughout the day also contribute to fat intake, consuming seven hamburgers in one day would likely exceed the recommended allowance when combined with other sources of fat. So the answer is yes."}
{"qid": "012786196d9ab6df3425", "transform_type": "gpt_4", "original_question": "Can Roman numerals fill the normal number of Sudoku box options?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Are Roman numerals limited to fewer options than Arabic numerals in Sudoku?", "explanation": "No.\n\nRoman numerals cannot fill the normal number of Sudoku box options because a standard Sudoku grid requires each row, column, and 3x3 box to contain the digits 1 through 9 without repetition. Roman numerals, however, are represented by letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and combinations thereof, which do not correspond directly to the single-digit numbers used in Sudoku. Additionally, the structure of Roman numerals, where values are added or subtracted based on order, does not lend itself to the simple, single-digit placement required in Sudoku. So the answer is no."}

The risk of bacterial growth and degradation of the cucumbers' texture and taste over a millennium would make them unsafe and unpalatable. So the answer is no."}

Can Paprika be made without a dehydrator?", "explanation": "Yes.\n\nPaprika is traditionally made by drying peppers in the sun or by using other methods such as oven-drying or air-drying. A dehydrator is not strictly necessary to create paprika, as long as the peppers are thoroughly dried and then ground into a powder. So the answer is yes."}

If the duration of Release Therapy is shorter than the time it takes to start watching Borgia's World of Wonders, then it would be possible. However, typically, an album like Release Therapy would last about an hour, and starting a show or movie would take less time. Therefore, it's unlikely you could watch the entire Borgia's World of Wonders before the album finishes. So the answer is no."}

The DRL Racer X drone has a top speed of about 179.6 mph. To calculate the time it would take for the drone to cross the bridge, we use the formula: time = distance / speed. Converting the bridge length to miles, we get 1.1 miles. Using the drone's speed, the calculation would be 1.1 miles / 179.6 mph ≈ 0.0061 hours. Converting hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds), we get 0.0061 hours * 3600 seconds/hour ≈ 22 seconds. Therefore, it would take the drone approximately 22 seconds to cross the Brooklyn Bridge, not 18 seconds. So the answer is no."}
