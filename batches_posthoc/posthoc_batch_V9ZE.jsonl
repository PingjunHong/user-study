While some films may depict nerds as socially awkward or less popular, many others show them as the heroes, geniuses, or successful individuals who play crucial roles in the story.

{"qid": "096acbba9f3e51c0f722", "transform_type": "contextualization", "original_question": "Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?", "model_answer": "yes", "followup_question": "The USDA recommends between 44 and 77 grams of fat a day. Do seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed USDA recommended fat allowance?", "explanation": "Yes, seven McDonald's hamburgers exceed the USDA recommended fat allowance. The USDA recommends a daily fat intake of about 78 grams for a 2000 calorie diet. A single McDonald's hamburger contains about 9 grams of fat. Therefore, seven hamburgers would total 63 grams of fat, which is well within the daily limit. However, considering that other meals and snacks throughout the day also contribute to fat intake, consuming seven hamburgers in one day would likely exceed the recommended allowance when combined with other sources of fat. So the answer is yes."}

Roman numerals, however, are represented by letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and combinations thereof, which do not correspond directly to the single-digit numbers used in Sudoku. Additionally, the structure of Roman numerals, where values are added or subtracted based on order, does not lend itself to the simple, single-digit placement required in Sudoku. So the answer is no."}

The risk of bacterial growth and degradation of the cucumbers' texture and taste over a millennium would make them unsafe and unpalatable. So the answer is no."}

Can you watch the Borgia's World of Wonders before Ludacris's Release Therapy finishes?", "explanation": "No.\n\nTo determine if you can watch the Borgia's World of Wonders before Ludacris's Release Therapy finishes, we need to consider the duration of each. If the duration of Release Therapy is shorter than the time it takes to start watching Borgia's World of Wonders, then it would be possible. However, typically, an album like Release Therapy would last about an hour, and starting a show or movie would take less time. Therefore, it's unlikely you could watch the entire Borgia's World of Wonders before the album finishes. So the answer is no."}

It is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive.
