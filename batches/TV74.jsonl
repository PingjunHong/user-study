Bowling pins and Oscars are fundamentally different in terms of size, shape, weight, and purpose. Bowling pins are designed to be knocked down by a bowling ball, while Oscars are awards meant to recognize excellence in the film industry. Substituting Oscars for bowling pins would not only be impractical but also disrespectful to the awards. So the answer is no."}

{"qid": "25a088d9d2ce674e639a", "transform_type": "gpt_3.5", "original_question": "Can eating grapefruit kill besides allergies or choking?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Is grapefruit toxic to certain individuals?", "explanation": "No.\n\nGrapefruit is generally safe for consumption and offers many health benefits. However, it can interact with certain medications, potentially leading to serious side effects or reducing the effectiveness of the medications. This interaction occurs because grapefruit contains compounds that inhibit an enzyme that helps metabolize certain drugs. It's important for individuals on medication to consult with their healthcare provider about their diet. Despite these interactions, grapefruit itself does not directly cause death if consumed responsibly and with awareness of potential drug interactions. So the answer is no."}

A king-sized mattress typically measures about 6.67 feet in width and 6.67 feet in length.
