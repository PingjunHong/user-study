{"qid": "83e854a290df701ecb8d", "transform_type": "gpt_3.5", "original_question": "Was being a mail carrier considered one of the most dangerous jobs?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Is being a police officer also considered a dangerous job?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Being a mail carrier is generally not considered one of the most dangerous jobs when compared to professions like logging workers, fishermen, or construction laborers, which frequently top the lists of dangerous jobs due to the high risk of fatal injuries and harsh working conditions. Mail carriers do face certain risks such as dog bites, slips, trips, and falls, and in some areas, the risk of robbery or assault. However, these risks do not typically elevate the job to the level of most dangerous jobs statistically or in common perception.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

{"qid": "3cb1925dc00aecc7ef83", "transform_type": "lexical_substitution", "original_question": "Would Bandy be likely to become popular in Texas?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Would Kick Around be likely to become popular in Texas?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Bandy, a sport similar to ice hockey but played with a ball, is not widely known or played in the United States, including Texas. Texas has a warmer climate and a culture more inclined towards sports like football, basketball, and baseball. Ice sports are less popular due to the climate, and there are fewer facilities compared to colder regions. Additionally, bandy requires specific facilities like a large ice rink, which are not commonly available in Texas.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"qid": "97ffbaa790ff9df718ec", "transform_type": "lexical_substitution", "original_question": "Are all the elements plants need for photosynthesis present in atmosphere of Mars?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Are all the elements plants need for photosynthesis present in Red Planet?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Photosynthesis requires several key elements, including carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Mars' atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, which is beneficial for photosynthesis. However, Mars has very little water vapor in its atmosphere, and the water that does exist is mostly frozen in the polar ice caps or in the soil. Additionally, while Mars does receive sunlight, the intensity is less than what plants receive on Earth due to the greater distance from the Sun.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"qid": "787aedef693b5860aac5", "transform_type": "scalar_adjustment", "original_question": "Are there any official American knights?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Are there at least one official American knights?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: In the United States, there is no system of knighthood as found in some European countries under monarchical systems. The U.S. honors individuals through various civilian awards and honors, such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom or the Congressional Gold Medal, but these do not confer a title of nobility or knighthood. The U.S. Constitution actually prohibits the government from granting titles of nobility. Therefore, there are no \"official American knights\" in the sense of a European-style knighthood.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Can an adult human skull hypothetically pass through the birth canal?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: The adult human skull is significantly larger and more rigid compared to a newborn's skull. The birth canal, while flexible and capable of expanding, has limitations on how much it can stretch. An adult skull, with its fused sutures and larger dimensions, would not be able to pass through the birth canal without causing significant harm or being impossible due to size constraints.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Do Republicans reject all forms of welfare?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Republicans generally support some forms of welfare, especially those that are targeted towards specific groups such as veterans or the elderly. They often advocate for reforms to welfare programs to reduce dependency and encourage self-sufficiency, but this does not equate to a rejection of all forms of welfare. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Republicans reject all forms of welfare.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

There is no scientific evidence suggesting that oysters have any negative effects specifically related to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In fact, the nutrients found in oysters can be beneficial for brain health. Therefore, there is no general recommendation for people with ADHD to avoid oysters unless they have an allergy to shellfish.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

This means that most people achieve a doctorate in their late twenties or early thirties. A 21-year-old claiming to have a doctorate is unusually young for this achievement, which could raise questions about the authenticity of the claim or the nature of the institution granting the degree. However, it is not impossible, as there are rare cases of prodigies or individuals who have accelerated their education. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Are any minor league baseball teams named after felines?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Minor league baseball teams often have unique and creative names, some of which are inspired by animals. To determine if any are named after felines, we consider common feline names such as Tigers, Lions, Cats, etc. The Lakeland Flying Tigers and the New Hampshire Fisher Cats are examples of minor league baseball teams named after felines. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"qid": "11f3a3f27f9029362aaf", "transform_type": "scalar_adjustment", "original_question": "Can surgery prevent an existential crisis?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Must surgery prevent an existential crisis?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: An existential crisis involves questioning one's purpose, meaning, or values in life, which is a psychological and philosophical issue. Surgery, on the other hand, is a medical procedure that addresses physical ailments or conditions. Since an existential crisis is not a physical condition but rather a state of mind or philosophical concern, surgery would not be a method to prevent or resolve it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

{"qid": "757a33340ccf017e9719", "transform_type": "scalar_adjustment", "original_question": "Do urban legends always have to occur in cities?", "model_answer": "no", "followup_question": "Do urban legends hardly ever have to occur in cities?", "explanation": "Trace of reasoning: Urban legends are a form of folklore that can be based on fictional, exaggerated, or sensational events. The term \"urban\" in urban legends refers more to their modern and popular nature rather than strictly to their location. Urban legends can occur in rural, suburban, or urban settings. The key aspect of urban legends is their widespread circulation and their typical reflection of contemporary social issues or fears, not necessarily their geographic setting.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
